# Decision Trees using Scikit-Learn easy to followup tutorial :)

## Overview
If you are new to scikit-learn use this tutorial to learn using simple classifiers like decision trees. If you want more advanced tutorial follow next notebooks where we are gonna
use more advanced methods and classifiers

## Dataset
In this notebok we will use iris dataset, a really famous dataset where we have five predictors variable, and one target variable.

## Notebook and code
We want to decide the target variable, (the dependant one if you want) using five predictors, first of all it's always nice to visualize data using libraries like seaborn,
we can gain a lot of informtion from the correlations of the features, and how the values distribute w.r.t. the target, for dataset like this it's always easy to visualiza patterns
but for large datasets it's not as easy to see relevant information.
Have fun :)

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

Python (preferably version 3.x)
scikit-learn: To install, run pip install scikit-learn
pandas: To install, run pip install pandas
seaborn: To install, run pip install seaborn
matplotlib: To install, run pip install matplotlib
Basic knowledge of Python and familiarity with data manipulation using pandas will be helpful but not necessary.
